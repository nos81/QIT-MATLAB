General
- more comprehensive test scripts with asserts


Control sequences
- GRAPE optimization


Noise
- different bath models, as classes?
- Markovian noise


Circuit model
- output Qcircuit.tex diagrams?


Examples
- adiabatic simulation


Entanglement
bipartite:
 e of formation: minimum of average E over pure decompositions
 distillable e, e cost, relative entropy of e.
