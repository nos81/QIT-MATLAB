2009-09-29    Version 0.9.1 (beta)
	      + version string in qit namespace
	      + examples: bb84 and markov_decoherence
	      * state/propagate redesigned
	      * Born-Markov noise package redesigned

2009-12-17    Version 0.9.2 (beta)
	      + state methods: fidelity, trace_dist, fix_phase
	      + plots/adiabatic_evolution
	      + examples/grover_search
	      b state/display fixed, prints also the imaginary parts
	      * renamed state methods: purify => to_ket, operator => to_op
	      * plots/tomography shows relative phases in color
	      * nicer examples
	      * lindblad.@bath class

2010-01-13    Version 0.9.3 (beta)
	      + utils/makemovie for making AVI movies of plots
	      + lindblad/superop
	      + state arithmetic: plus, minus, mtimes, mrdivide, normalize
	      + examples/superdense_coding
	      b state/measure now gives correct collapsed states
	      * gate/qft now also handles non-qubit systems
	      * state/propagate now uses ode45 for time-dependent Hamiltonians
	      * examples/nmr_sequences produces nicer plots

2010-01-19    Version 0.9.4 (beta)
	      + utils: majorize, spectral_decomposition
	      + Harmonic oscillator package
	      + ho methods: ladder, displace, squeeze, coherent_state,
	      	 momentum_state, position_state, wigner
	      + examples/qubit_and_resonator
	      * state/measure now also measures arbitrary observables

2010-02-04    Version 0.9.5 (beta)
	      + state/locc_convertible
	      - state/overlap (replaced by fidelity)
	      + ho methods: position, momentum, husimi
	      + utils/asongoficeandfire
	      b utils/lrmul did unnecessary work
	      * Born-Markov package again reorganized, uses lookup
	      	 tables more efficiently
	      * neater examples

2010-02-??    Version 0.9.6 (beta)
	      * Born-Markov package cleaned up and renamed: +lindblad => +markov
